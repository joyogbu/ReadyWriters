# Design and Implementation of a multi-user blogging system
This project aims to create a multi-user blogging site which is like a mini content management system in which prospective users will create an author's account from which they can sign in to their dashboard to create, update, or delete their own posts.
A user will also be able to manage his or her profile from his or her dashboard
A user can create posts on any category of his choice grouped as relationship, lifestyle, tech, and business
The project features an ‘About the Author’ section which also helps to advertise a user based on his registered bio.
